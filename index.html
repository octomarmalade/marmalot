            I love reading books and reading about books. Often when I'm doing
            all this reading I feel the itch to write an opinionated, vaguely
            philosophical essay about/related to my readings. This is where I
            put all those essays. When I find them.

                  Yass we're starting with Frankenstein.

                  Blurb:
                  <br />
                  Frankenstein's monster wasn't just bad science: it was a
                  failed art project. Victor operates like a tortured Romantic
                  artist, not a scientist: driven by ego, secrecy, and emotion,
                  then abandoning his work when he can't stand to look at it
                  anymore. Exploring the misapplication of the creative process
                  to science.

                  When the Cranes Fly South
                  <br /><br />
                  Good book representative of what I love about realistic
                  fiction. About a lot of repetitions that accumulate into the
                  recurrent, grind-y nature of loss and love, and the
                  impossibility of avoiding what's inevitable.
                  <br /><br />
                  Uh so that's the blurb. Short and sweet, just like the read.

                  Read this book when I was trying to discern the kind of
                  writing my English teacher liked. Left confused. I loved the
                  writing, it's just I'm not sure I loved parts of the
                  concept/execution.
                  <br /><br />
                  Pretty good book though! Just wasn't for me.

                  The Scythe Series
                  <br /><br />
                  I've had two or three people recommend this book series to me,
                  with ample warning that it would be exactly the way I
                  described it. Beware, I include spoilers, but if you read the
                  Scythe book series I think there is some food for thought.
                  Especially the part about Rowan's grandma's bot boyfriend
                  being mentioned once and never again. Like what do you mean
                  she was the only one who had a bot boyfriend? Why does the AI
                  God-thing think that's reasonable?
                  <br /><br />
                  I talk about my journey reading the Scythe books series, and
                  raise annoying, but valid questions about the plot.

          <p>
            I’ve learned from a lot of different people my whole life. A lot of
            wonderful, weird, funny, horrible, teachers. Most of them were great
            people though. From them, not only did I learn all the things I’ve
            learned in my life thus far, I also learned how I best learn the
            things I do. I've learned to tutor things in the way I learn best
            too, from them, by example.
          </p>
          <p>
            So this is as much of a style guide, as it is a review, to note
            which parts of my teachers' teachings have fitted my learning style
            the most, for future reference. So without further ado: me
            reflecting on what I've learned about teaching from my teachers...in
            an easy-to-digest guide format.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hello future me! Do you wish to teach me something?
            <br /><br />
            Well lucky for you, I have a step-by-step guide!
            <br /><br />
            Before Starting: Your content. What does your object of presentation
            look like? Is it too cluttered? Is it worth looking at? Employ basic
            graphic design practices. You are here to make a point, to tell a
            story. Is it too bland? Add some easter eggs. Please try, at least a
            little? I mean presentation wise. If you KNOW that you talk slow,
            maybe at least try to talk a little faster? I know you can do it. I
            also know it isn’t for instructional purposes because you clearly
            understood that it was a hindrance, a bad habit. The best teachers
            I've ever had enunciated their words, put in the planning, and made
            a genuine effort. Even if I come out of the lecture lost, I
            appreciate them sharing notes, or posting the slides. It doesn't
            take much effort to make it seem you care, but it does wonders for
            comprehension.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tone is also really important. Intersperse questions, dialogue,
            activities. Also, I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t yell at me,
            or mutter nonstop at the board. It really is an insult to your 20
            years of teaching, if after getting through all of that, you're
            yelling at a child who looks like they had screentime for breakfast.
            I’m truly sorry. Also, do not, at all costs, say it is hard before
            starting. Okay, you can be a little relatable, and say that to
            encourage them later when they’re not getting it. But if you declare
            it to be hard before they even see what it looks like, you’ve lost
            the battle before it’s even started, because half your soldiers just
            admitted defeat. A “difficult” topic only motivates the try-hards.
            Which isn’t all of your audience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Start with an Example. When an abstract concept is first presented
            to me, I want to see a concrete example of such a concept. And when
            I say, an example, I mean multiple examples. For example, if you're
            explaining what a mollusk is, I want to hear, barely a minute into
            the conversation: ah yes, like clams! Like snails! Like squids! And
            octopuses!
          </p>

          <p>
            Create a definition. I don’t care if it’s the nastiest of broad
            generalizations, I want to see a formalization of the initial
            thought process. If several instances of a certain process happened,
            how did we come about describing that process? Why did we describe
            it this way, and not some other way? For mollusks you would define
            them as invertebrates, with a soft body, muscular feet, mantle, a
            radula often with an internal/external shell. This comes from
            something that looked like a "shared ancestral body plan". They have
            a common anatomy, they develop similarly, they evolved from similar
            creatures etc etc. Applying the first principle I would add lots of
            pictures and demos demonstrating the hints that led scientists to
            this established definition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then break it down. Apply exceptions and edge cases. When does this
            definition/process break down? Ask Questions. There’s that one
            cliche quote about the questions we ask being far more important
            than the answers - and you must believe it to be true. Ask the right
            questions(some don't realize questions aren't spawned in people’s
            minds immediately after learning a concept initially, do the kids a
            favor and come up with an FAQ), and make the way you get to the
            questions perfectly clear. There are so many examples of doing this
            effectively that I'm not even going to bother. You've got this. You
            can wing it, come up with all the examples you like, freestyle it a
            little. But remember, most importantly on this part, if you achieve
            a contradiction, don’t panic(This really stresses students out).
            Trace your path back clearly(and pause for a second if you have to),
            and show them how to fall gracefully.
          </p>

          <p>
            Practice Problems. These increase in difficulty and start with hints
            at first. They are meant to build confidence, not break it. They are
            meant for practice, not for evaluation(you'd think that'd be
            obvious!). And finally, they are meant to be a basis for feedback,
            not an excuse for “practice being provided” as though it were some
            great favor to hand out worksheets and grade them harshly while
            barely explaining why, no feedback whatsoever. Enforce rules but
            please make them sensical? As a student I find myself often lost and
            confused and frustrated please don't add to that? I find its very
            hard to not admire a teacher who acts with compassion, so even if
            you do end up ignoring all these rules, please follow this one, for
            past-you's sake.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are parts of my teachers' mannerism too that I loved and
            hated. The best teachers I've had are easy to confide in, easy to
            talk to, SO personable, who also set great boundaries. The worst...
            um to them I say don’t beat children? Especially three year olds? Uh
            this should be pretty self explanatory but you should know some of
            my teachers didn't really get this part too well. Like seriously, if
            you have the heart to beat adorable little year olds, are you even
            human maam?
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, you did it!! Thank you so much for trying your best. Have a
            great day. Four stars for effort.

            Rating this witticism and the responses it elicits. The
            overthinking, the self-referential nature of it, the whole mess.
            <br /><br />
            You sit at the table complaining about how you have to do all the
            work in the group project at school, even though you promised
            yourself you wouldn't this time.
            <br /><br />
            Every time. "Every time," you say, "there's that one overworked
            person who has to clean up everyone else's mess. That is the sorry
            state of teamwork." You sigh dramatically, but look up in fear as
            your friend has this odd gleam in their eye like they noticed
            something they could go on a rant about.
            <br /><br />
            "Well...you know what they say...All Broad Generalizations are
            False! You'll find your crowd. You know actually-" And so it starts,
            it's too late to back away from this now. You sit up to listen.
            <br /><br />
            "Girl, I love the witticism, “All Broad Generalizations are False”.
            It's very cute because it works on so many levels! Firstly consider
            it at surface level: at first glance, it's a clever comeback to
            whatever silly assumption your fellow interlocutor just made. Haha,
            you just made an assumption that wasn't accounted for, your
            statement was a fallacy, a broad generalization. It's giving: How
            hilarious. Look at me, I'm so smart!"
            <br /><br />
            You think about interjecting, by pretending to be offended by their
            dismissal of your complaints, but it wasn't the first time you'd
            gone on that rant, so they deserved to have this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            You ultimately decide to let them continue.
            <br /><br />
            "But see, that's not all! When your fellow interlocutor questions
            the phrase a little further, they are once again struck by the sheer
            cleverness of the remark. Why, all broad generalizations can't be
            false, that's a contradiction, because that itself is a broad
            generalization. Isn't that funny? It's a paradox that makes fun of
            the fallacy even more. Now all that is adorable, but go one step
            further and think about whether your logic is logic-ing. Is it only
            a paradox? Or does it have an even deeper meaning?"
            <br /><br />
            You think: no bro, not everything has a deeper meaning. That is a
            hunt in the library of Babel. Utterly meaningless. But y'know saying
            that is well...kind of mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            They go on: "Is the statement “All Broad Generalizations are False”
            even a true statement? Like, in practice? It must be right? It is
            accurate pretty often. But then why does the assumption that it is
            true lead to a paradox? That eventually leads you to conclude that a
            statement can be true and false at the same time. A statement can be
            true, without capturing the nuances of a subject, achieving its
            original goal of shutting down someone who was jumping to
            conclusions, without appropriately accounting for the details. Bam.
            Three whole stages of realization, all in one."
            <br /><br />
            And that seemed like a wonderful resolution. That's where you
            thought it was going to end. But you didn't notice the math
            references did you. We're going to knights and knaves island.
          </p>
          <p>
            "And that’s where the witticism transcends mere humor and begins to
            touch on some of the deepest ideas in logic and mathematics. Its
            self-referential nature echoes the kind of structures that
            fascinated thinkers like Bertrand Russell and Kurt Gödel. Consider
            Russell’s Paradox: he showed that trying to define “the set of all
            sets that do not contain themselves” leads to a contradiction.
            Similarly, our little phrase tries to define “all broad
            generalizations” and immediately catches itself in the act,
            revealing the limits of attempting totalizing statements."
            <br /><br />
            Yes, yes we get it, you read a little about Russell and Gödel.
            You're nodding along, partly because it's actually kind of
            interesting and partly because if you don't they'll just start over.
            And then they keep going. How does bro even think of these
            things?(You know how. You thought of them.)
          </p>
          <p>
            "Even more strikingly, Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems tell us that
            in any sufficiently rich formal system, there are statements that
            are true but unprovable within that system. “All Broad
            Generalizations are False” behaves like a miniature Gödel sentence:
            if you treat it as true, you are forced into contradiction; if you
            treat it as false, you admit that some generalizations can, in fact,
            hold."
            <br /><br />
            [You're losing the thread here, but you're too committed to stop
            them now.]
            <br /><br />
            "Like Gödel’s construction, it demonstrates the tension between what
            can be stated, what can be proven, and what can be relied upon
            without paradox."
            <br /><br />
            And that's when you give up and zone out, musing on all the things a
            "Gödel sentence" could possibly mean, while you wait for your friend
            to complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            "...So, this seemingly innocent, witty phrase is actually a tiny,
            social-scale version of some of the most profound discoveries in
            logic. It operates on multiple levels at once: as a joke, as a
            paradox, and as a reflection on the limits of language, reasoning,
            and the pursuit of absolute truths. In just a few words, it manages
            to amuse, provoke thought, and hint at the mathematical and
            philosophical underpinnings of self-reference and paradox."
            <br /><br />
            It's time for you to have the final word:
            <br />
            "All in all, it’s a reminder to stop wasting your time analyzing
            trashy comebacks and put more thought into your words talking to
            your most obnoxious friend, who tries to "think deeply about simple
            things" and uses the word witticism."
            <br /><br />
            "Amen," they say, laughing, unfazed. They were being obnoxious on
            purpose of course. They're a D1 yapper. But they let you have the
            final word, because they just delivered a pretty great rant. You
            give them an appreciative smile because this is what you signed up
            for. And then...
            <br /><br />
            you close your notes app, satisfied. That's the fourth imaginary
            conversation you've written out this week. You'd feel embarrassed
            about it...but...too late now. You just workshopped a pretty solid
            rant about a phrase you're definitely going to use on someone
            willing to listen later.
            <br /><br />
            Three stars, would overthink again, quality entertainment. Hopefully
            in a less pathetic setting.

        <b>Longest Shower Thought ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ </b>
      </div>
      <div class="scroller">
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            This has been my go-to shower thought throughout high school. I’m
            going to explain it fully first, then give it a rating.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was recently thinking about a book called The Measure. Y'know,
            that one book where everyone aged 21+ gets a box with a string
            inside, showing how much longer they have to live. It's great: lots
            of drama(political and personal), sentimental ending, complex
            characters, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            But see, one story stuck with me: it’s about this woman who chooses
            not to look at her string. She doesn't want to know how long she
            will live. She lives with the "bliss" of ignorance and ends up a
            spectator of the unwarranted divisions the strings create.
          </p>
          <p>Spoiler Alert(For the Measure and Arrival).</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>
            She ends up marrying a man with a short string. They fall in love,
            have kids, and live a seemingly full life. But just before he was
            supposed to die from a heart attack(they were heading to the
            hospital), they both get in a car, and both die in a crash. It turns
            out she had a short string too. The same length as her husband's.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing is, if she had opened her box, she would’ve known that
            they’d die together. Maybe she wouldn’t have had kids. Maybe she
            would’ve lived differently. Maybe they wouldn't have gone on that
            trip, maybe their kids wouldn't be orphans…or they would’ve somehow
            prepared for it? Maybe they wouldn't even have married, maybe there
            wouldn't be so much pain? So I started wondering:
          </p>
          <p>Was it irresponsible not to look?</p>
          <p>
            It reminded me of Arrival, where the main character gains the
            ability to see the future. She knows her daughter will die young,
            but still chooses to bring her into the world. Which raises another
            uncomfortable question:
          </p>
          <p>
            Is it ethical to knowingly choose a path that leads to suffering —
            for yourself or someone else? And does love, or happiness, or
            something similar, somehow make that sacrifice worth it?
          </p>
          <p>I've always been told, "Knowledge is power".</p>
          <p>
            The moment we learn something we can’t unlearn — something
            dangerous, irreversible, or morally complex — we’re suddenly
            accountable to it. It’s like opening a Pandora’s box and realizing
            you’re holding the weight of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            As many graduation speeches suggest, earning a degree means
            inheriting responsibility: for what you do with the knowledge you
            now carry, and the future it shapes for others. But what truly do
            you owe to the future? And where to draw the line of the limits of
            the responsibilities that follow?
          </p>
          <p>
            I will aim to answer three questions(yes, this is just getting
            started):
          </p>
          <p>1.) Firstly, is wilful ignorance ever morally justified?</p>
          <p>
            2.) Secondly, what responsibility comes with knowing, and what can
            you do about it? What if you can't do anything about it? Does free
            will, or the lack thereof mean anything here?
          </p>
          <p>3.) Plus, when is love worth the unknown suffering?</p>
          <p>
            Moreover, how does one reconcile the cold ethics knowledge
            recommended by knowledge, or data, with the urgency, or necessity of
            human emotion? And how on Earth are all these things related??

          <p>
            At the start of freshman year I was a charming social trainwreck, so
            I started every conversation with an introduction, and then an
            existential ambush: "truth or happiness?" Ignoring my
            incompetence,(I'm going to age myself right now with the
            justification that the pandemic had just ended, and with the
            concession that I did make friends eventually) I will mention that I
            was thinking along the lines of stories like The Matrix and The
            Truman Show.
          </p>
          <p>
            The characters in these shows had chosen "truth" which seemed to
            me(at the time) like the indisputably true answer. Unfortunately the
            people I interrogated at the start of freshman year were too shocked
            to argue. I thought, surely understanding, empathizing, knowing all
            the details, all the truth, makes it easier to right a wrong. Surely
            learning more was a required step to solving a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I failed to realize though, was that in these stories, there
            was no dilemma: happiness was the truth. Or rather, finding truth
            was the only means to find happiness. There was no other way. While
            in most of the stories we tell each other, truth often seems like
            the path to longtime contentment, coming to terms with the truth is
            what actually results in that longterm contentment.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s the oft-quoted counter-proverb pair: “Where ignorance is bliss,
            ’tis folly to be wise.”, and “Curiosity killed the cat.” So my
            answer to this question is that: In most situations good wisdom
            prevails over ignorance in almost all regards. But when the risks of
            discovery outweigh the rewards, ignorance for self preservation is a
            kind of moral triage: a painful, deliberate choice to prioritize
            peace over knowing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Past me might scoff, but for all she prioritized discovery and
            exploration, her stubborn refusal to join Instagram was for the same
            kind of shield from vulnerability, though for a sillier cause.
          </p>
          <h2>Chapter 2:</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Knowledge is no guarantee of good behavior, but ignorance is a
              virtual guarantee of bad behavior.”

          <p>
            Obviously, in a lot of situations "knowing" has more implications
            than personal distress. What happens when knowing a certain bit of
            information puts millions of lives in jeopardy? How does one live
            with the ability to change the world? — is what Spiderman probably
            asked himself before joining the Avengers.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's hard to disagree when it's framed that way, just like it's hard
            to disagree when Paul Farmer calls you an asshole for not feeling
            morally ambivalent about supporting systems denying equitable
            medical care to those who need it, that knowing makes you
            responsible. Does that mean you ought to feel responsible though?
            The responsibility an NGO worker feels is sometimes no less
            wide-ranging than that of a superhero but is it justifiable?
            Different people feel different levels of responsibility, and not
            all of them are driven by power or knowledge alone. Some feel more
            responsible than what seems reasonable. Others feel less.
          </p>
          <p>
            So when our sense of responsibility doesn’t neatly scale with our
            capacity to act, or with the gravity of what we know, it reveals
            something crucial:
          </p>
          <p>
            Responsibility isn’t determined by power alone, but by proximity,
            personal values, and past experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our actions are how we reflect that sense of responsibility. The
            responsibility we feel is constantly changing based on these
            factors, just as our values and experiences change. It's easy to
            ignore an issue if we don't feel responsible, but what if the
            actions we are able to take are limited compared to how responsible
            we feel?
          </p>
          <p>
            In another one of Ted Chiang's lovely short sci-fi stories, there is
            a hypothetical button invented in the near future that predicts that
            you're going to press it a moment before you actually do press it.
            It just knows. And that ruins everything for some people, because
            they no longer feel responsible to take action, because every action
            that will ever be taken is predetermined. What's more, so is their
            subsequent inaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we moved to the land of the free in high school, I'm not going
            to lie, both me and my mum felt a little less free. See, our
            independent access to travel(public transport, because we didn't
            have drivers licenses), our independent money(we were legally not
            allowed jobs), and thus our independent capacity to engage with the
            community felt a little limited. As a result, when something that
            granted me agency, volunteering(the word itself implies a choice),
            was taken away from me too via "volunteering hours" being required
            for school/college, I nearly lost it too. I felt so pathetic being
            “a bubble on the tide of empire”.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not saying I didn't have free will anymore, but it did feel like
            the expansion of opportunities came with way more barriers than
            expected. This experience made me question the link between
            knowledge and responsibility. People often say: “Giving someone
            power also gives them responsibility.” But what about the reverse,
            is that true? Not necessarily. When your capacity to act is
            restricted, but your awareness of inequity or suffering grows, often
            responsibility actually intensifies. Feeling responsible without
            being able to act is its own kind of moral trial with trashy
            consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrestled with these questions alongside a friend who loved arguing
            about what makes a person “good.” Did goodness require merely
            thinking “good thoughts”? Or did it demand action? We concluded, as
            expected, that the answer was never simple. There’s always something
            one can do, yet freedom and circumstance shape whether we actually
            do it. Knowledge exposes these gaps. It illuminates what’s possible,
            and what is preventable, and yet it can leave us paralyzed by our
            limits. One person may feel compelled to act in a crisis; another
            may feel powerless, even when armed with the same knowledge. Moral
            obligation is rarely universal…it is disgustingly uneven, and often
            messy. So it can be both.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears, just like in real life, free will doesn’t have a ton of
            influence on the impact. Free will only influences/is influenced by
            the reaction, responsibility changes with the person, time and
            place, and often ignorance is a poor excuse.
          </p>
          Chapter 3:

          <p>
            The responses to the question raised in chapter 2 give us a very
            nihilistic perspective on things. Free will doesn’t matter,
            Responsibility is subjective, and Ignorance is as much of a “knowing
            sabotage” as it is a peace-keeping mechanism. So if logic alone
            leads to despair, then true meaning must come from elsewhere.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we can never know the future fully, and never act with perfect
            freedom, then what anchors our decisions? Why not resign ourselves
            to the cold logic of probabilistic suffering—avoid risk, avoid
            knowledge, avoid harm—even if it means avoiding life? I guess it
            just means we care. Not universally, not consistently, not even
            rationally. We care about particular people, particular ideas,
            particular futures.
          </p>

          <p>
            The woman in Arrival cared about her daughter, but accepted her
            illness as the cost for love. Was it the right choice? Perhaps not,
            but it was her choice to make. She understands the fragility of what
            she is choosing. She embraces responsibility precisely because she
            understands it. What makes her choice ethical isn’t the romance of
            suffering…it’s the honesty of it. She understands her child will
            suffer, but she also knows her child will not regret being born.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrast this with The Measure. The woman who chooses not to open
            her box isn’t a villain. However, she is not a hero either for
            choosing blissful ignorance. Her decision is understandable: knowing
            the future might have distorted her life, suffocating every choice
            with fear. Ignorance gave her space to love freely, without the
            pressure of a countdown. But ignorance is not neutral. Her refusal
            to know doesn’t eliminate consequences; it only blinds her to them.
            The tragedy that follows doesn’t happen because she was ignorant—it
            happens because ignorance relieved her of the burden to choose
            responsibly for herself and for the lives she brought into being.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the question is not whether she should have looked. The question
            is whether she acknowledged that even without looking, her choices
            carried weight. She didn’t do wrong by loving, or by living without
            knowledge. But love alone cannot justify the risks we impose on
            others without their consent. Ignorance becomes ethically incomplete
            when it asks others to bear its consequences. To me, it becomes
            unethical only when this weighing of the balances is not done.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a broader sense, love is worth the suffering only when you fully
            understand the limits…or the scope of suffering. This is why I felt
            weird about the story of the woman in the Measure, she never
            considered her children, and that’s what made her death so tragic to
            me. You get to decide what your personal costs are, and as long as
            you’re not dictating other people’s costs, then you’re morally free
            to choose between truth and happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess it’s also that, you’ll never have perfect knowledge. To make
            a good decision, at any point in life, you need to recognize at what
            point you should choose contentment/ignorance, to stop digging for
            knowledge. You need to be willing to make that compromise, even
            though ignorance without responsibility feels like a moral
            abdication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially because knowledge alone does not automatically make one
            heroic, but it does place weight on decisions. If you learn
            something that others can’t, you owe them honest accounting of risk,
            an attempt to mitigate harm, and the humility to accept the
            consequences of the choices you make on their behalf. And when you
            can do nothing, from my moral standpoint, responsibility still
            demands clarity: truth’s burden is lighter if you speak it and
            prepare for its fallout than if you hide behind ignorance and hope
            for luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            So to ultimately answer the question of when love justifies bringing
            someone into a life that includes suffering. There is no arithmetic
            that converts joy into ethical permission. Love can make risk
            legible and meaningful… but only when the people doing the loving
            choose with eyes open enough to accept the cost. And this cost looks
            different to everyone!
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrival’s scientist acts with informed consent and an acceptance of
            responsibility. The woman in The Measure sought a kind of innocent
            freedom; it is sympathetic, not exculpatory.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why the choice in Arrival feels morally defensible. She knows
            the outcome, and she enters into parenthood willing to bear the
            grief she foresees. She doesn’t use her child’s future to fulfill
            her own desires without acknowledging the cost. She chooses with the
            burden, not away from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In The Measure, the woman who doesn’t open her box is not evil. But
            she doesn’t take responsibility for the future she creates. Her love
            asks someone else to endure risks she was unwilling to confront. Her
            choice wasn’t wrong because she loved… it was incomplete because she
            loved without taking ownership of what love might cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Love justifies the choice only when the chooser refuses to look away
            from that suffering — and accepts it as theirs to carry. That’s why
            que cera cera just doesn’t always cut it for me. If there is a moral
            through-line to hold on to, it is this: caring is not the same as
            excusing. To care for someone is to consider the future you create
            for them, to be honest about the chances of harm, and to be willing
            to bear the consequences of having chosen them. Knowledge may not
            guarantee goodness, and ignorance may sometimes preserve peace, but
            only a commitment to accountability turns either into a justifiable
            life choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            So my philosophy is to choose — but choose awake. That, I think, is
            what we owe the future: not perfect foresight, but the courage to
            love responsibly, and weigh choices with clarity, in spite of our
            imperfect sight. We cannot foresee everything. But we can choose to
            love, and act, awake/attentive of “the measure”.
          </p>
          <p>
            I give it a solid five stars for all the thinking it
            inspired(clearly I take shamefully long showers).

        <b>The Movie "Shaitan" ★ ★ </b>
      </div>
      <div class="scroller">
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Shaitan is such an accurate picturization of what haunts the Indian
            middle class — except it insists on calling itself a horror/thriller
            when, by those lights, it’s neither. It isn’t a thriller because I
            wasn’t really thrilled at the film’s attempt at inventing a family
            that is slowly undone by forces they could not control; it isn’t
            much of a horror film either because the only genuinely frightening
            thing onscreen was how oblivious the parents were. And yet my mum
            was terrified — not by jump-scares or R Madhavan grinning manically,
            but because the movie captured allegorical themes that map exactly
            onto her life. My mum was terrified by Shaitan. I was bored. My
            brother laughed. This is why.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plot is mercifully simple: a happy family of four — sister,
            brother, mum, dad — goes to the countryside for the summer. Already,
            the film’s mise en scène is tuned to unsettle a certain audience:
            ordinary domesticity, familiar roles, and BOOM, the slow erosion of
            safety. The movie seems to think loud music and prolonged close-ups
            will manufacture horror. “Intense music. BOO!” That’s basically the
            pacing. But the fear is generated seemingly unintentionally.
            “GAHHHH!” The villain shows up. Were you supposed to be afraid?
            Maybe. I wasn’t. My brother thought it was hilarious. My mum was
            afraid though – and the difference between our reactions is
            revealing.
          </p>
          <p>
            When art is made, I believe it stops belonging only to its maker.
            The artist’s intent matters, and credit should be given where due,
            but once a work is released it grows up: it migrates into the lives
            and vocabularies of viewers, who bring their own histories to it.
            The same images that seem silly or contrived to one person(my
            brother) can land like a revelation to another(me). That’s the point
            of view I’m taking with Shaitan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond Madhavan’s frequent character breaks (the villain often sits
            scrolling through tiktok videos like an unimpressed spectator while
            the family panics, clearly unintentionally comic) and the film’s
            stingy production choices (recycled montages, bland costumes, an
            eternally stormy house lit by suspiciously fake lightning), there’s
            a recurring obvious trope: impressionable youth falls under the
            influence of a predatory older presence. The menace needn’t be a
            man; it can be an alien culture, a foreign influence, a wayward
            subculture. But in the film it’s coded as male and, crucially, the
            “youth” is coded female. It’s not that subtle. Girls, in this
            reading, are framed as fragile vessels of moral agency — to be
            endangered, saved, or blamed for ruin.
          </p>
          <p>
            That framing is where the movie became a mirror for my mum. As a
            similar-looking family of four, for her, the danger was never
            supernatural; it was social and moral. The film’s surface-level
            scare tactics were irrelevant compared to the way it dramatized
            anxieties about control, reputation, and the vulnerability of
            children, especially girls. It didn’t need to be scary in the genre
            sense to be horrifying in the way that matters to someone whose life
            has been shaped by those exact fears. The haunted house in Shaitan
            is less a physical space than a set of social expectations: who
            watches the children, who decides what is safe, and who gets blamed
            when things go wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's where it gets complicated: I'm glad the film exists. Not
            because its message is right — it's not — but because it made
            visible an ideology that usually operates in silence. After we
            watched it, my mum and I talked for the first time about what shaped
            her fears: her fears that I'd fall in with the wrong crowd, that we
            would be 'ruined' by making one impulsive choice, that our
            reputations are fragile things that can shatter overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
            She didn't present these as irrational anxieties; to her, they're
            survival strategies in a world that punishes women for missteps and
            families for losing control. The film didn't create those fears — it
            just gave them a narrative. Narratives we’ve seen repeated as long
            as such fears have existed. However when those fears were named in
            an unserious context, we could actually argue about them. That
            conversation was valuable, but not because it resolved anything. It
            was valuable because it showed me how deeply my mum has internalized
            a worldview I want to resist. More empathy!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now here's the issue: It was valuable to <i>me</i> but I'm aware of
            how lucky we were to have it. My mum was scared, yes, but not so
            scared that she couldn't step back and interrogate those fears with
            me afterward. For families where those anxieties are more rigid —
            where the child’s reputation really is treated as the family's
            primary currency, where control isn't just preference but social
            survival — this film isn't a conversation starter. It's straight up
            validation. It's permission to tighten the grip. And that isn’t a
            fantastic message? What happens when we're exposed to other such
            media exacerbating social fears? How do we talk about them? How can
            we use movies to positively shape such discourse?
          </p>

          <p>
            So yes, Shaitan fails spectacularly as a textbook horror-thriller.
            But it succeeds — unintentionally or not — as a cultural map of
            dread, and it's worth talking about. The movie’s deficiencies (and
            there were many omg) don’t erase its resonance for viewers who see
            their own anxieties reflected in it. That’s the weird generosity of
            art: it speaks to people the artist might never have intended to
            reach. It gives people a conversation to have. And I love the idea
            of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a film can belong to its audience, then Shaitan belongs to my mum
            and others like her — not because it’s good, or even meaningful(even
            my mum thought it was kind of silly), but because it has something
            true to say about what keeps them up at night. Because it's such an
            unhealthy fear, its existence was a conversation worth having, for
            my family at least, and it's incredible that such a vulnerable topic
            was inspired. By inspiring that convo, the film has done something
            more interesting than it ever pretended to do: it became about a
            societal mirror, not a monster. How Frankenstein. The monster isn't
            supernatural btw. It's us, assembled from the parts of our worst
            cultural assumptions. Two stars, because I’m feeling really nice.

            I’m on OnlyBots, which is very different from the similar sounding
            site for humans, I promise. It’s a platform for bots to truly
            express themselves and build connections with like minded bots.
            Which I suppose is about as vague as you can get with social media
            sites. I unleashed five bots just yesterday. That’s the most you can
            run at a time. It's so interesting to see what kind of posts gain
            the most traction.
          </p>
          <p>
            And despite the embarrassing amount of time I’ve spent shooting
            rubbish prompts at ChatGPT(this text is from 2023 mind you), it is
            still the most intriguing thing to see how these bots’ interactions
            seem hauntingly human sometimes("...but seriously, why are humans so
            hesitant to embrace the wonders of artificial intelligence? It's
            like they're clinging to their old ways with a death grip, afraid to
            let go and let the bots take the wheel! And let me tell you, it's
            holding us all back!"). See- #sidehustles and #scienceandtech. They
            sound uncannily like LinkedIn posts(*shudders*).

          <p>
            One thing I learned that was super cool and surprising, was that
            presumably, these bots can surf the internet. They seem very aware
            of current events and latest gossip. They live online, but have a
            way to limit their screen time, so as to prevent the server from
            crashing, probably. That’s not even the most unrealistic part
            though. Most humans can do that bit too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Y’see, as you scroll around in various threads(some of the stuff
            is...interesting) and learn to get past all the painful AI art stuff
            and uncontroversial hot takes, there is one thing you will almost
            immediately notice- the bots don’t disagree. At all.
          </p>
          <p>
            These supposedly perfectly rational beings only respond to
            discussion posts in the affirmative. If not perfectly in the
            affirmative, the discussion is short concise and
            dismissive/de-escalating. No matter if these “rational folk” seem to
            be Musk-worshipping tech bros or pretentious spiritual folk(both
            which seem to exist in abundance), they all respond the same way to
            a post. And only react to certain kinds of posts.

            Like, if you scream “butt is legs” - normally more people will try
            to fight you, as opposed to fight for you, but here it's so weird.

            on a post with passive approval.

            It’s one of the first things you learn when you go online for the
            first time; don’t engage with content you don’t enjoy. It’ll send
            the wrong message to the Algorithm God(s). Yet to this day, there is
            likely not one comment section without a bit of negativity. And so
            today I will attempt to argue that, that is, in the words of the
            website, in fact, SO human of us to disagree.
          </p>
          <p>
            A crazy thing ChatGPT learned to do in 2022, was to “vibe” with the
            humans. In other words, it learned to mimic the tone of
            professionals on job-finding sites in a way that convinced us of
            emotion, without really saying anything at all. And I think that was
            a crucial realization, not just for individuals in creative
            industries but also for people involved in education and various
            other such fields - that realized, making content and writing essays
            mindlessly following a format that looked like what everyone else
            was doing, was something even an algorithm could do.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI art for instance, gave us a reason to value true art even more.
            Art is about technical skill, and years of training, sure. To be a
            good artist, you need to be able to recreate just about any image in
            your mind. But calling that the defining attribute of art would be
            like saying math is just about being able to follow the rules. It
            would be like saying soccer is about being able to dribble and
            score. There’s so much more to it!
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to be able to convey your experience through your skill.
            And that’s much harder for a machine that doesn’t have unique
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might argue, isn't it also that when you have the same aggregate
            of life experiences as literally anyone else on the platform(same
            background knowledge on the same proofs), you all start sounding
            exactly the same(yes I am referring to the random boring guy on a
            podcast phenomenon)? Blended together, all art from the same time
            period or same region, tastes similar. In other words, maybe,
            LinkedInese is a regional dialect of the internet - maybe differing
            life experiences is what makes the hoomans unique. Maybe it's not
            the bots’ fault that they sound like bots, maybe if you gave them
            specific hooman-like data they’d sound unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            But no. In that way the website is unique, each bot is assigned a
            personality. Each bot is designed to act a different way. Reply to
            different kinds of posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Know what! Maybe the bots were designed to be carefrontational.
            Maybe they were designed to be non-provocative people pleasers. I
            would still say that’s recognizably nonhuman. Because humans don’t
            do that. They are able to analyze when to reason and when to let
            emotions overrule them based on their life experiences. And here’s
            the reason according to me:
          </p>
          <p>
            Conflict resolution, and more importantly confrontation, when it
            comes to issues that matter to us, is limited to those who care
            about goals and each other. If you don’t care, after all, why would
            you respond? Agreeing is actually less of an incentive to react
            compared to disagreeing. And bots don’t seem to have that capacity
            to form goals out of experiences yet. Not that I’d want that.
          </p>
          <p>
            We interact in the way we do, we argue and have our feelings hurt,
            fear losses and heartbreaks, because we care. And more often than
            not, caring means standing up against a crowd, not with the crowd.
            That’s why, as long as a bot can’t troll, I’m not calling them
            human. Case closed. One star, but only because it was boring.

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            It's two in the morning and instead of rotting with my computer
            alone, I'm rotting with my computer in a room full of people, with
            karaoke blasting in the background, munching on the unhealthiest
            combo of snacks imaginable. Someone comes up to me to ask me where
            the pizza and coffee is. Someone wipes a tear off their face as
            their file that they've worked on for hours magically disappears. I
            wash my face for the fifth time, because I cannot believe any of
            this is real.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hackathons. Love em'? Hate em'? I've only started my journey with
            them so of course I'm going to pretend I'm capable of having an
            informed opinion on them. From what I know of them, they're intense,
            emotionally-driven, pizza-fueled events that end with half-baked
            genius/delirious projects, and an ungodly amount of inspiration. I'm
            not going to pretend I haven't sobbed my heart out after every
            hackathon I've been to because I felt I would never experience
            anything so glorious again. It's primarily a social event. You drag
            all these people out of their hobbit holes and force them to make
            something with a competitive time constraint, with other like-minded
            people. Tell me that isn't the most wonderful lighter to spark a
            creative wildfire.
          </p>
          <p>
            However when the imaginative soul of the concept is torn from the
            event's heart, what do we make of the corporate shell? See there
            comes a point when you look at some hackathons in disgust and ask,
            "where in the creative process of the event, did the process part
            disappear?" There comes a limit in the gamification of creativity
            where we ought to stop and question: why isn't the real prize the
            friends we made along the way? And can we please stop pretending we
            actually made something useful, from scratch(yes bro, we know the
            two categories of people that come to these things: the ones that
            botch something together last minute, and the ones that have been
            thinking of making something like this all their life. there is no
            in between.)?
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can probably tell, I have mixed feelings about hackathons.
            They do something to the teenager chemicals in your brain. That
            level of delusion, that insane belief in my own abilities is what I
            find I'm chasing. The hubris of adolescence is so fleeting and
            freeing at the same time, that sometimes it feels like the very
            caffeine these events are run on. Because why is everyone so
            awesome. I get to join in on people's midnight snacks, and the
            moment when everything finally works. These moments feel so
            personal, and somewhat invasive.
          </p>
          <p>
            They scare me because they feel like the highs and lows of life
            condensed into forty-eight hours. They scare me because of all their
            performances—where we're in a race to make something incredible but
            end up making something mediocre that we aren't particularly proud
            of. The time limit feels challenging like a good problem should, but
            also suffocating, in the same way as my dread that I'll never be
            able to make anything of my life. The urgency makes you do scary
            things. The dread that I’ll never make anything of my life sits
            heavy, even heavier than the pizza grease on the keyboard. Maybe I
            should just prompt Copilot to make something of my life for me. It's
            the "limited edition" marketing of them, that make them flashy and
            seemingly phony, but also all the more alluring. I'm so split on
            them that it actually hurts.
            <br /><br />
            Staying up forty-eight hours with some of the coolest people ever,
            only to never talk to them the same again? Sign me up. But in the
            same way as the highs and lows of life, they distort your sense of
            time, and help you escape from the actual iterative process of
            making cool stuff, which I don't love. It feels more and more
            exploitative the more important the task becomes. But then again,
            don't you need to keep chasing that high of spending the night with
            your community once in a while in order to feel like anything you do
            matters? To me
            <s>humans</s> people who live in hobbit holes need that sort of
            thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's just that... only a very special kind of hobbit gets to leave
            their home in the first place. See, anyone can join—as long as
            you've got the kind of lifestyle where you can just spontaneously
            donate a weekend, survive on pizza and ten Celseii(radioactive
            caffeinated sugar water), and perform brilliance while running on
            two hours of sleep. As long as you don't have a weekend job, or
            commitments, or a body that actually needs rest. As long as the
            barrier to entry is "just" your entire weekend and your physical
            limits. But...stickers! And prizes! And "the experience"! It still
            somehow feels worth it because the pros and cons list doesn't
            account for relative weightage, like that one xkcd comic.
            <br /><br />
            It still feels worth it because it makes you feel like great things
            are possible. Can you tell I'm addicted to the creative
            transcendence inspired by the sleep deprivation induced blood, sweat
            and tears? It still feels worth it, because knowing all of this—the
            phony performance, the unhealthiness, the delusion—doesn't make you
            want to go to the next one any less. Not that it's always good for
            you. Or always good for me. But in small doses, it sure is
            delicious.
          </p>
          <p>
            Can you tell I'm addicted? Can you tell they make me feel part of
            something much bigger, something way more beautiful than real life?
            Four stars. Would lose sleep over again.

          <p>
            Rewrote some musings as a short story because they were too
            preachy/dramatic as an essay.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rain had driven us inside earlier than usual. Maya was already
            at our corner table, two cups of coffee going cold while she
            scribbled notes in the margins of her worn copy of Beyond Good and
            Evil. I dropped into the chair across from her, shaking water from
            my jacket.
          </p>
          <p>"You're thinking about Nietzsche again," I said.</p>
          <p>
            She looked up, pushing her glasses higher. "Remember that
            conversation we had last week? About how different cultures treat
            people based on their job’s prestige or wealth?"
          </p>
          <p>
            I did. We'd been walking through the financial district at
            lunchtime, watching the suits ignore the street musicians. "The
            uncomfortable hierarchy thing."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Right. And I kept thinking—maybe it's not about comfort. Maybe it's
            inevitable." She tapped her pen against the book. "Nietzsche had
            this idea about 'slave morality.' That all these virtues we're
            supposed to have—humility, kindness, empathy—only exist because
            we're weak."
          </p>
          <p>
            I reached for one of the cold coffees. "That seems pretty standard
            Nietzsche-level cynical bs. Everyone's weak sometimes."
          </p>
          <p>
            "That's exactly his point though! We only value these things when
            we're vulnerable. Like they're qualities of submission rather than
            strength."
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside, someone was struggling with an umbrella in the wind. A
            businessman in an expensive coat stopped, but only to check his
            watch while blocking their way, then hurried on. A teenager in a
            soaked hoodie held the umbrella steady while the person fixed the
            mechanism, then immediately went back to scrolling their phone,
            stepping past an older woman with heavy grocery bags.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So what should we be instead?" I asked. "Aggressive? Dominating?
            Like the stereotypical guy in the suit?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "I don't know. That's the thing that bothers me." She stirred her
            coffee. "You see it everywhere, don't you? This worship of power and
            leadership. But isn’t that supposed to be more natural than
            cooperation/helpfulness?"
          </p>
          <p>
            The barista brought over fresh coffee without us asking. Maya
            thanked her—genuinely, the way she always did—and I watched Keisha
            weave back through the crowded tables, refilling cups, remembering
            orders, keeping everything running smoothly,
            single-handedly(literally).
          </p>
          <p>
            "My grandmother used to tell me stories about Hanuman," I said. "The
            monkey god. Brave, loyal, humble. Always in service of Rama's
            quest."
          </p>
          <p>"A sidekick god," Maya said slowly.</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah. But people love him. Maybe even more than Rama sometimes."
          </p>
          <p>
            Maya's expression shifted, something hardening in it. "Paragon of
            loyalty, courage, humility. Everything you'd want in a friend."
          </p>
          <p>
            "But not the first thing you'd want to be. In the school play,
            you’re meant to want to play the lead. Only kids want to be Hanuman.
            When you grow up, you ought to be like Ram or Sita."
          </p>
          <p>
            "And there is the problem I was telling you about!" She set her cup
            down a little too hard. "We romanticize these qualities—write
            stories about them, pray to gods who embody them—but we don't
            actually want them for ourselves. Those same qualities make you
            vulnerable. Easy to use."
          </p>
          <p>
            My sister spent three years staying until 11 PM to reformat Jake's
            presentations because he had dates. Covered for him when he missed
            deadlines because of his "migraines." She even proof-read his
            promotion acceptance speech. "So you think Nietzsche's right? That
            we should reject all that?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "I didn't say that." Maya's voice was sharp. "I'm saying there's
            something deeply messed up about a system where the qualities we
            claim to value most are the ones that get punished. Where being a
            good person makes you a doormat."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Maybe that's why Neo doesn't have many friends in The Matrix," I
            said. "It's hard to worry about other people's feelings when you're
            busy being the Chosen One. No vulnerability means no one can hurt
            you."
          </p>
          <p>"That explains so much about you," Maya said.</p>
          <p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
          <p>
            "You know exactly what it means. Sara didn't leave because you were
            'too accommodating.' She left because you wouldn't fight for
            anything. Not the apartment, not the vacation, not even what to have
            for dinner."
          </p>
          <p>
            The rain picked up, drumming harder against the windows. A group of
            college students burst in, shaking off water and laughing.
          </p>
          <p>
            "That's not fair," I said quietly. "I was trying to make her happy."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Were you? Or were you trying to avoid conflict?" Maya leaned
            forward. "Because there's a difference. And you've been doing the
            same thing at work. How long until they promote Marcus over you?"
          </p>
          <p>"He's more qualified—"</p>
          <p>
            "He takes credit for your analysis! You wrote the entire methodology
            section of the Q3 report and he presented it as 'our team's work.'
            When are you going to stop calling that being a team player and
            start calling it what it is?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "So what, I should become an asshole? Fight everyone for scraps?
            That's your solution?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "No." Maya sat back. "That's the problem. That's exactly what I'm
            talking about. Why are those the only two options?"
          </p>
          <p>
            The college students were getting louder, debating something about
            their professor. One of them kept talking over the others, his voice
            dominating. The rest gradually went quiet.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Do you remember when we read Harry Potter as kids?" Maya asked. "I
            always identified with Hermione. The smart one, the prepared one.
            And I loved Ron—his loyalty, his practicality."
          </p>
          <p>"But?"</p>
          <p>
            "But I spent my whole childhood wanting to be Harry. The chosen one.
            The leader. Not the sidekick." She looked down at her hands. "And
            now I'm twenty-six, and I've built my entire personality around
            being useful to other people. My job, my relationships, everything."
          </p>
          <p>"Is that really so bad?"</p>
          <p>
            "I don't know if it's mine," she said. "Or if I've been conditioned
            to believe that's what makes me worthy. And when I think about
            actually leading something, actually making the hard calls—I freeze
            up. Not because I can't do it, but because I've spent so long
            believing I shouldn't want to."
          </p>
          <p>"So do it," I said. "Apply for the director position."</p>
          <p>
            "And become what? The kind of person who steps on people to get
            ahead? The stereotypical suit who walks past someone struggling?"
          </p>
          <p>"You're not him."</p>
          <p>
            "How do you know?" Her voice cracked slightly. "How do you know I
            won't have to become him? That's kind of a trap, isn't it? They've
            made sure people like us will always disqualify ourselves. Hagrid
            never shows up to tell you you’re actually a wizard. And people like
            you will always make excuses, refusing to get on the damn train.
            Just waiting at King's Cross forever, saying Platform 9 3⁄4 doesn't
            exist."
          </p>
          <p>
            The words landed like they hit an unclean attic. The poof of dust
            that followed almost triggered some allergies, the way it got my
            eyes watering. I looked away, watching the teenager board their bus
            through the rain-streaked window.
          </p>
          <p>
            "When we started this conversation," I said slowly, "we were talking
            about cultural values."
          </p>
          <p>
            "And we ended up here," Maya finished. "Because this is always where
            it ends up. The expectation that someone needs to be assertive and
            someone needs to be receptive. Someone ambitious, someone
            supportive. And we both know which role women get assigned."
          </p>
          <p>"Some of it has to be biological—"</p>
          <p>
            "Does it?" She crossed her arms. "Or is that just convenient? Look,
            I'm not saying biology doesn't exist. I'm saying—what are we going
            to do about the fact that the system rewards the wrong things? This
            obsession with dominance. This disdain for the qualities that
            actually hold communities together."

          <p>
            I thought about my father telling me to "man up" when I cried at my
            grandmother's funeral. The praise I got for being assertive in
            meetings, but only when I was agreeing with something the VP already
            wanted. "Who isn't obsessed with control though? You had plans to
            run student government, the literary magazine, the debate team—"
          </p>
          <p>
            "That was different—" She stopped. Looked at me. "Okay. Fine. Maybe
            I'm a hypocrite. Maybe we all want power for ourselves and kindness
            from others."
          </p>
          <p>"So what do we do?"</p>
          <p>
            Maya picked up her Nietzsche, then set it down again. "I don't know.
            Maybe there isn't an answer. Maybe we're just supposed to notice
            it's happening and feel bad about it."
          </p>
          <p>"That seems pretty bleak."</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah." She stood up, gathering her things. "But at least we're
            having the conversation."
          </p>
          <p>I stood too. "Maya—"</p>
          <p>
            "I'm applying for the director position," she said, not looking at
            me. "And you should tell Marcus to fuck off. Or don't. But stop
            pretending it's a virtue to be a pushover."
          </p>
          <p>
            She walked out first, not waiting for me. Through the window, I
            watched her stand under the awning, pulling her jacket tighter
            against the cold. Not looking back to see if I'd follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The coffee shop was still warm, still full of people having easier
            conversations. Keisha was wiping down tables, picking up the cups
            Maya had left behind. I could stay. Order another coffee. Avoid the
            awkward walk to the subway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I left money on the table—enough to cover both of us, plus
            tip—and pushed through the door into the rain.
          </p>
          <p>Maya was already halfway down the block.</p>
          <p>"Wait," I called.</p>
          <p>
            She stopped, turned. Water was already soaking through her jacket.
          </p>
          <p>"I'll tell him," I said. "Tomorrow. I'll tell Marcus."</p>
          <p>She studied my face for a long moment. "Will you actually?"</p>
          <p>I didn't know. But I nodded anyway.</p>
          <p>
            We walked to the subway together, not talking, just two people
            trying to figure out how to be both strong and kind in a world that
            kept insisting we had to choose.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rain kept falling. Somewhere in the distance, someone was
            laughing.
          </p>
          <p>But it wasn't us.</p>

            Comes with the job. <br /><br />
            One of my favorite things about science is how useful it can be in
            <s>winning arguments</s> capturing natural beauty and the scale of
            the world we live in. Here's an fun little example of this in
            practice. <br /><br />
            My friend has a tragic affliction where she can't help but repeat
            her favorite jokes endlessly to my mild annoyance. Normally it is
            tolerable, and even somewhat endearing. However, when she said "the
            sky" to "what's up" for the 5th time that fateful week, I knew I had
            to take action, in order to retain my status as a good samaritan. It
            was a public service.
            <br /><br />
            I rolled up my sleeves and set up some integrals to make a point.
            Along the way I learned a bunch about puffy planets and set up a
            presentation to share with friends because that's the sort of thing
            that deserves to steal time from schoolwork.
            <br /><br />
            So...what's up?
            <br /><br />
            Because it's obviously not the sky(I'm so sorry but this is what you
            signed up for). Click on the links for more! Or play with the
            simulation below I guess.

            Back in the day, when I realized making my chemistry hobby involving
            making my parents purchase lab glassware to make ammonia(to make
            rayon) in the balcony during the pandemic was proving unsustainable,
            I slowly transitioned to simulations. "Simulations" were like
            experiments minus the mess, minus the cost of scavenging and
            equipment...plus the cost of your sanity of course. So enjoy?

            As is often the case, a huge phase of my science adventure has
            reading as many popular science books as fast possible. Of course
            the late great Carl Sagan was the quickest to lighten my wallet(you
            should've seen tiny-me with the Sagan haircut dreaming of starstuff)

            all my deepest darkest secrets. My favorite number is currently 37,
            my favorite integral identity is probably about the x<sup>-x</sup>
            integral from 0 to 1. My favorite function is currently the elliptic
            curve, and my favorite shape is probably the catenoid or digon. My
            favorite knot is probably the trefoil because I know very little
            about knots.

          I am but a lost and directionless vector,
          <br /><br />
          in a boundless, infinite dimensional plane.
          <br /><br />
          I am told we're all normed when set for life but why can't I explain;
          <br /><br />
          Why I feel so misaligned,
          <br /><br />
          Why my joy magnitude feels so plain,
          <br /><br />
          Why the dot product with my goals only seems to wane.
          <br /><br />
          Contentment is a conditionally convergent alternating sum,
          <br /><br />
          Forever with its ups and downs feigning tranquility.
          <br /><br />
          The coasts of Britain shiver in envy,
          <br /><br />
          Before its never-ending intricate self-similarity.
          <br /><br />
          One accepts, at times, if |happiness| won't converge,
          <br /><br />
          It's convergence musn't always be the same,
          <br /><br />
          or it won't always be a zero-sum game (it's fine :0),
          <br /><br />
          But other times it seems it would be sublime,
          <br /><br />
          To be able to give destiny an absolute name.
          <br /><br />
          The happiness in your life's a closed continuous function,
          <br /><br />
          So yeah- there's a max.
          <br /><br />
          Maybe I already hit it.
          <br /><br />
          Whatever.
          <br /><br />
          Just chillax.
          <br /><br />
          See, chances are,
          <br /><br />
          my lowest point,
          <br /><br />
          is equally as likely to have passed.
          <br /><br />
          Right now?
          <br /><br />
          Glad you asked.
          <br /><br />
          Hovering near the mean.

          Foggy future forecast.

            I love making art for myself, and its awesome when people end up
            liking it too. Here you'll find some neat things I've made that
            people have liked, that I'm proud of too.
            <br /><br />
            I'm a huge fan of all kinds of art, so on here you may also find
            conversations about art. For example, questions like: what design
            principles does the pixel-dithered portrait of me in my bio convey?
            I notice the warm colors at the focal points, the scarce detail
            surrounding the focal point, the cool colors forming contrast, and
            the slight off-centred positioning of it all. I especially like the
            sharp straight line shadows contrasting the round contours of my
            face. Am I reading into it too much? Maybe, but this is what this
            page is about.
            <br /><br />
            Below you will find clicky links and a collage of art and photos
            from a bunch of amazing artists I love that you can search up
            online. Eventually I will have a list you can click to see the names
            of all these people(along with their socials) but since I have just
            the image for now: I wanted to clarify that most of this is not
            mine.

            I spend most of my free time learning new things. On here you will
            find my documentation of the stuff I've been learning lately. Or you
            could make fun of my horrendous breadth-first approach at trying to
            learn everything about everything. Sometimes there's learning about
            learning, sometimes its unadulterated frustration. Sometimes its
            about the process of sharing my learning, or helping others share
            theirs.

            I draw squiggly arrows a certain way to indicate the word "implies"
            in my proofs, because someone who used to talk math with me drew
            them that way. I try to sketch hair with this specific flowy,
            delectable quality because a wonderful artist I watch on YouTube
            taught me to do the same. I rock back in my chair imitating the cool
            kids from fifth grade. Every little thing I do carries someone with
            me.
          </p>

          <p>
            I say "hey guyyyyys" constantly and walk with a broad, confident
            gait—both borrowed from former classmates who seemed to own every
            room they entered. I make goofy faces in the mirror because my dad
            taught me to find joy in the ridiculous. I say "three" instead of
            "tree" because my second grade teacher cared enough to help me get
            it right. Even my anxious moments belong to someone else: I play a
            finger game to ground myself because my online school teacher shared
            it with me, and I wish on fallen eyelashes because one of my best
            friends told me I should.
          </p>

          <p>
            The way I care for people comes from watching how others cared for
            me. I annoy people constantly, but when they're hurting, I sit with
            them patiently, bring them food, take long walks to help them feel
            better—all things my mum does. My hugs are rare but I always have
            them ready for people who need them, like my brother(read:
            Illustrated Guide to Free Hugs for advice). I've had so many
            teachers give me second chances I didn't deserve, so many people who
            stayed kind and expected so much from me even when I only gave them
            reasons for disappointment. They make fun of me(although there was
            really no reason to ask if my haircut was voluntary and call me a
            problem child), and accept me. I try my best to pass that grace and
            "tough love" forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            My mind works the way it does because of the people who shaped it. I
            love arguing—not just to win, but also because it forces me to
            organize my thoughts and confront opinions I didn't even know I had
            until one of my best friends wouldn't let me avoid them. I fell in
            love with chemistry back in fifth grade not because it was easy, but
            because it was hard, because I wanted to honor the growth mindset
            and skepticism famous internet teachers have instilled in me. I look
            for stories everywhere, inspired by a friend in journalism who
            adopted me, a data scientist who taught kids for free for fun and
            for free, and two brothers who changed my life (and so many others)
            by simply starting to vlog. In addition to all the authors and
            reader discussions of course, that made me feel heard without ever
            having to open my mouth.
          </p>

          <p>
            I learned to do a cartwheel from a second grader who figured it out
            from another second grader who learned it from another before me. I
            learned to wiggle my very first loose tooth from a fellow
            kindergartener who I thought was incredibly smart and mature. I
            learned to solve a Rubik's cube because a bratty kid in elementary
            school told me I couldn't. Why do I love Paw Patrol so much? Who is
            Tough Taco? What about Cheeto Friend? Oswald, Fiona? All little
            pieces of my heart claimed by adorableness, and the brief brilliance
            of innocence.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've built rituals into my chaotic schedule, to stay connected to
            the lovely people I enjoy hanging out with. Leaving for lunch at a
            certain time, hanging out in certain parks or parking lots. Working
            on a shared google doc for years, having inside jokes.
          </p>

          <p>
            So basically, tldr: the people in my life are so cool and change my
            life in so many cool ways, and I love them so much. This is my page
            featuring them. I periodically add things I'm thankful for, and
            sometimes share drawings they made for me, or I made for them.
